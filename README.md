# clean-desktop
Automated desktop cleaner. This program automatically moves all files from the desktop to the destination folder. Furthermore, the files are organized based on the file type and current date. This script is designed to be easy to modify the watch and destination paths. Additionally, it's easy to extend this to support additional file types (or change sub-directory paths for specified file types).
